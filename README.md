SUMMARY

In this project, I have tried to find out the factors that are most important for getting an approval for the credit card through the power of Data Analysis and Machine Learning. Though we have achieved 82% of accuracy, we also tried to check if we can improve the performance further and tried decision tree. However, 82% is the best we could get from this data using  logistic regression
